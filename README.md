# Playground

## Overview

Welcome to my repository! This project is a platform for creating interactive 3D scenes by combining the power of Blender and Three.js. Whether you are a 3D artist, a web developer, or someone interested in exploring the capabilities of Blender and Three.js, this playground provides a creative space for experimentation and collaboration.

## Features

- **Blender Integration**: Leverage the power of Blender to create and export 3D models for use in the playground.
- **Three.js Rendering**: Utilize the capabilities of Three.js for rendering and interacting with 3D content in the web browser.
- **Interactive Environment**: Experiment with different materials, lighting, and camera setups to create visually stunning 3D scenes.
- **Easy Setup**: Follow the simple setup instructions below to get the playground up and running quickly.
